As per the recieved mail, I'm under doubt with some other students for having cheated in the exam. But it is not confirmed who's the culprit. The mail made me quite mentally unstable and therefore I am unable to focus on the upcoming 4 exams.

So, kindly allow us to meet you after these exams. 
Hope you understand our situation
Thanking in anticipation

[19/05/22, 5:26:10 PM] Ankita Tulsyan Ece: A survey was conducted one month back on transportation facility and choices of students were recorded. It has been noticed that many students are willing to prefer some other transportation facility. So, a new transportation facility is likely to be introduced to our campus. Most probably an E-rickshaw chain. As our main focus is to provide better facility to our students rather than doing a business, we are keeping the charges to minimum possible price, so that every student can afford it. 
Following are some questions regarding the prices, routes and some of our future projects. It will barely take 2-3 minutes. Your response will help us to evaluate and improvise our facility and future projects.
Your valuable response is most welcome.
